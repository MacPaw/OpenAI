## What is OpenAI

OpenAI is a non-profit artificial intelligence research organization founded in San Francisco, California in 2015. It was created with the purpose of advancing digital intelligence in ways that benefit humanity as a whole and promote societal progress. The organization strives to develop AI (Artificial Intelligence) programs and systems that can think, act and adapt quickly on their own – autonomously. OpenAI's mission is to ensure safe and responsible use of AI for civic good, economic growth and other public benefits; this includes cutting-edge research into important topics such as general AI safety, natural language processing, applied reinforcement learning methods, machine vision algorithms etc. 

>The OpenAI API can be applied to virtually any task that involves understanding or generating natural language or code. We offer a spectrum of models with different levels of power suitable for different tasks, as well as the ability to fine-tune your own custom models. These models can be used for everything from content generation to semantic search and classification.

## Installation

OpenAI is available with Swift Package Manager.
The Swift Package Manager is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the swift compiler.
Once you have your Swift package set up, adding Alamofire as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the dependencies value of your Package.swift.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/MacPaw/OpenAI.git", .branch("main"))
]
```

## Usage

### Initialization

To initialize API instance you need to [obtain](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) API token from your Open AI organization. 

<img width="1081" alt="Screenshot 2022-12-19 at 2 23 45 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1411778/208425483-9dd02a1c-d3ab-4efd-bf44-736e5bcb89c0.png">

Once you have a token, you can initialize `OpenAI` class, which is an entry point to the API. 

```swift
let openAI = OpenAI(apiToken: "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE")
```

Once token you posses the token, and the instance is initialized you are ready to make requests. 

### Completions

Given a prompt, the model will return one or more predicted completions, and can also return the probabilities of alternative tokens at each position.

**Request**

```swift
    struct CompletionsQuery: Codable {
        /// ID of the model to use.
        let model: Model
        /// The prompt(s) to generate completions for, encoded as a string, array of strings, array of tokens, or array of token arrays.
        let prompt: String
        /// What sampling temperature to use. Higher values means the model will take more risks. Try 0.9 for more creative applications, and 0 (argmax sampling) for ones with a well-defined answer.
        let temperature: Int
        /// The maximum number of tokens to generate in the completion.
        let max_tokens: Int
        /// An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.
        let top_p: Int
        /// Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.
        let frequency_penalty: Int
        /// Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.
        let presence_penalty: Int
        /// Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The returned text will not contain the stop sequence.
        let stop: [String]
    }
```

**Response**

```swift
struct CompletionsResult: Codable {
    struct Choice: Codable {
        let text: String
        let index: Int
    }

    let id: String
    let object: String
    let created: TimeInterval
    let model: Model
    let choices: [Choice]
}
```
**Example**

```swift
openAI.completions(query: .init(model: .textDavinci_003, prompt: "What is 42?", temperature: 0, max_tokens: 100, top_p: 1, frequency_penalty: 0, presence_penalty: 0, stop: ["\\n"])) { result in
  //Handle response here
}
```

```
(lldb) po result
▿ CompletionsResult
  - id : "cmpl-6P9be2p2fQlwB7zTOl0NxCOetGmX3"
  - object : "text_completion"
  - created : 1671453146.0
  - model : OpenAI.Model.textDavinci_003
  ▿ choices : 1 element

      - text : "\n\n42 is the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything, according to the book The Hitchhiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy."
      - index : 0
```

### Images

Given a prompt and/or an input image, the model will generate a new image.

As Artificial Intelligence continues to develop, so too does the intriguing concept of Dall-E. Developed by OpenAI, a research lab for artificial intelligence purposes, Dall-E has been classified as an AI system that can generate images based on descriptions provided by humans. With its potential applications spanning from animation and illustration to design and engineering - not to mention the endless possibilities in between - it's easy to see why there is such excitement over this new technology. 

**Request**

```swift
struct ImagesQuery: Codable {
    /// A text description of the desired image(s). The maximum length is 1000 characters.
    let prompt: String
    /// The number of images to generate. Must be between 1 and 10.
    let n: Int?
    /// The size of the generated images. Must be one of 256x256, 512x512, or 1024x1024.
    let size: String?
}
```

**Response**

```swift
struct ImagesResult: Codable {
    struct URLResult: Codable {
        let url: String
    }
    let created: TimeInterval
    let data: [URLResult]
}
```
**Example**

```swift
openAI.images(query: .init(prompt: "White cat with heterochromia sitting on the kitchen table", n: 1, size: "1024x1024")) { result in
  //Handle response here
}
```

```

### Utilities

The component comes with with several utilities to work with vectors

```swift
public struct Vector {
    
    /// Returns the similarity between two vectors
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///     - a: The first vector
    ///     - b: The second vector
    public static func cosineSimilarity(a: [Double], b: [Double]) -> Double {
        return dot(a, b) / (mag(a) * mag(b))
    }

    /// Returns the difference between two vectors. Cosine distance is defined as `1 - cosineSimilarity(a, b)`
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///     - a: The first vector
    ///     - b: The second vector
    public func cosineDifference(a: [Double], b: [Double]) -> Double {
        return 1 - Self.cosineSimilarity(a: a, b: b)
    }
}
```

**Example**

```swift
let vector1 = [0.213123, 0.3214124, 0.421412, 0.3214521251, 0.412412, 0.3214124, 0.1414124, 0.3214521251, 0.213123, 0.3214124, 0.1414124, 0.4214214, 0.213123, 0.3214124, 0.1414124, 0.3214521251, 0.213123, 0.3214124, 0.1414124, 0.3214521251]
let vector2 = [0.213123, 0.3214124, 0.1414124, 0.3214521251, 0.213123, 0.3214124, 0.1414124, 0.3214521251, 0.213123, 0.511515, 0.1414124, 0.3214521251, 0.213123, 0.3214124, 0.1414124, 0.3214521251, 0.213123, 0.3214124, 0.1414124, 0.3213213]
let similarity = Vector.cosineSimilarity(a: vector1, b: vector2)
print(similarity) //0.9510201910206734
```
>In data analysis, cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two sequences of numbers.
